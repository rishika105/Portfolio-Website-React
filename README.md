# ðŸŒŸ My Portfolio Website

Welcome!  
This is my personal portfolio where I showcase my projects, skills, and journey as a developer.  

ðŸ›  **Built with:**
- [React.js](https://react.dev/)
- [React Bits](https://www.reactbits.dev/)
- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  
ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose:**  
Designed to create a clean, responsive, and interactive experience for visitors to explore my work and get to know me better. I used **React Bits** and **Aceternity UI** extensively â€” they offer **awesome pre-built components** like buttons, cards, navbars, animations, and more. If you're a developer, **I highly recommend checking them out too** â€” they can save you tons of time and help you build sleek designs faster!
